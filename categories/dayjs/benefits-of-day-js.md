- With a comparable [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction), Day.js is intended to be a simple substitute for Moment.js. Day.js is not a drop-in replacement; however, if you are accustomed to working with Moment’s API and need to move swiftly, consider this.
- With Day.js performance at a high rate.
- Day.js is lighter than Moment.js since the package size of Date.js is only about 232 kB. Day JS’s most recent version is 7Kb ([minified](https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/minification/)) and 2Kb in size (Gzipped).
- Day.js can be included as a JavaScript file from a [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN) or local file in addition to supporting import and require.

**There’s one drawback, however:**

- The features of Day.js are fewer than those of Moment.js.
