### What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?

A child class constructor cannot make use of `this` reference until the `super()` method has been called. The same applies to ES6 sub-classes as well. The main reason for passing props parameter to `super()` call is to access `this.props` in your child constructors.

**Passing props:**

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
  }
}
```

**Not passing props:**

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();

    console.log(this.props); // prints undefined

    // but props parameter is still available
    console.log(props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
  }

  render() {
    // no difference outside constructor
    console.log(this.props); // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
  }
}
```

The above code snippets reveals that `this.props` is different only within the constructor. It would be the same outside the constructor.
