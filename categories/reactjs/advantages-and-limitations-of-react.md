### What are the advantages of React?

Below are the list of main advantages of React,

1. Increases the application's performance with _Virtual DOM_.
2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
3. It renders both on client and server side (_SSR_).
4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

### What are the limitations of React?

Apart from the advantages, there are few limitations of React too,

1. React is just a view library, not a full framework.
2. There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.
